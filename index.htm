   <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm not just talking about my own stuff, there are some very good jams in the ninjam environment. But these are forgotten over time. If I can somehow keep a diary and categorize it, I hope it will at least be findable. There is now an <a href="https://jamsradyo.blogspot.com/p/search.html">advanced search</a> section where you can do multiple keywords and list jams by genre, sound, mood and various tags.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That's why I made such a blog.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I always say that there is a need for a community for improvised music. Although it is not possible to do this with the blogspot infrastructure, it is still possible to publish your writings here as a blogger writer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is also an anonymous comment/chat feature for each post.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you are interested in improvised music, especially if you use ninjam, you are welcome to participate. We also have a telegram group on the subject, which you can join here:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/ninjammers">https://t.me/ninjammers</a></p><p>If you don't want to use telegram, you can join this discord server where we bridge discord and telegram:</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/tYZAb5nmpG">https://discord.gg/tYZAb5nmpG</a></p><p>Via the web if you don't want to use both:</p><p><a href="https://ninjammers.github.io/">https://ninjammers.github.io/</a></p>
